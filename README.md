## About this course

>In our Master Class you'll learn Vue.js by building a real-world application. Together we’ll create a complete forum from scratch using exciting technologies that synergize with Vue.
>
>If you’re tired of in-comprehensive tutorials or “super courses”- that will “teach you everything there is to know about Vue.js in 39 minutes”, but in reality only show a few concepts and do not include how to build a real-world application with what you just learned - we think Vue School will be delightful as a light breeze in a hot summer day.
>
>Every lesson is scripted and thoroughly reviewed, which means that the videos are on point and paced just right!
